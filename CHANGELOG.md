# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows [Angular version numbers](https://angular.dev/reference/releases) (major version = supported Angular major version).

## [20.0.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Upgraded to Angular 20** (`@angular/*` 20.3.x, `@angular/material` + `@angular/cdk` 20.2.x).
  `peerDependencies` now require `@angular/common` and `@angular/core` `^20.0.0`. Install
  `@ngui/auto-complete@20` for Angular 20 projects.
- **Standalone components.** `NguiAutoCompleteComponent` and `NguiAutoCompleteDirective` are now
  standalone. `NguiAutoCompleteModule` is **retained** and re-exports both, so existing
  `imports: [NguiAutoCompleteModule]` consumers keep working unchanged — you can now alternatively
  import the standalone component/directive directly. (Full NgModule removal is planned for Angular 21.)
- **`inject()` DI.** Constructor parameter injection across the library was migrated to the `inject()`
  function (no public API change).

### Internal (development tooling only — no impact on consumers)
- `ng update` to Angular 20: `@angular/cli` + `@angular-devkit/build-angular` 20.3.x,
  `ng-packagr` 20.3.2, `angular-eslint` 20.7.0. Workspace migrations applied (schematic `type`
  defaults in `angular.json`, `tsconfig` `moduleResolution` → `bundler`).
- Bumped `@cypress/schematic` 4.3 → 5 (now requires Angular 20).
- Re-enabled the `@angular-eslint/prefer-standalone` lint rule (deferred in 19.0.0).
- The demo app was migrated to a standalone `bootstrapApplication` setup (`AppModule` and the routing
  NgModule removed in favour of `provideRouter` + `app.routes.ts`).
- Hardened the library component spec so its focus-triggered dropdown reload resolves against a local
  source array (Angular 20 / zone.js surfaces the previously-swallowed async error).

### Notes
- ESLint 10 remains deferred: `angular-eslint` 20 still peers on ESLint `^8.57 || ^9`. It is planned for
  the Angular 21 release alongside full NgModule removal.

## [19.0.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Upgraded to Angular 19** (`@angular/*` 19.2.x). `peerDependencies` now require `@angular/common`
  and `@angular/core` `^19.0.0`. Install `@ngui/auto-complete@19` for Angular 19 projects.
- Migrated the library template to Angular's built-in control flow syntax (`@if` / `@for` in place of
  `*ngIf` / `*ngFor`).

### Internal (development tooling only — no impact on consumers)
- Migrated ESLint from `.eslintrc.json` to flat config (`eslint.config.js`); upgraded ESLint 8 → 9 and
  switched to the unified `angular-eslint` and `typescript-eslint` packages.
- Bumped dev dependencies to the newest versions compatible with Angular 19: `cypress` 13 → 15,
  `@cypress/schematic` 2 → 4.3, `eslint-plugin-cypress` 3 → 6, `jasmine-core` + `@types/jasmine` 5 → 6,
  `@types/node` 22 → 24, `karma-jasmine-html-reporter` 2.1 → 2.2 (reduces `npm audit` from 52 to 9).
- Added unit specs for the library component and service, and replaced the stale Angular CLI boilerplate
  demo specs with working `TestBed` setups.

### Notes
- The library remains NgModule-based in this release; the standalone migration is planned for the
  Angular 20 release.
- ESLint 10, `@cypress/schematic` 5, and the standalone migration are deferred to the Angular 20 release
  (they require Angular 20 / angular-eslint 20).

## [18.6.0] — 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- `select-value-of` now correctly extracts falsy property values (`0`, `null`, `false`, `''`) from the
  selected object — previously the truthiness check caused the raw item to be emitted instead of the
  extracted property (fixes #373)

### Added
- `no-match-found-text=""` (empty string) now fully suppresses the "No Result Found" row — previously
  the empty string fell through to the default text (fixes #307, #292, #198)
- `(noMatchFound)` output on both `<ngui-auto-complete>` component and `[ngui-auto-complete]` directive —
  fires whenever the filtered list is empty and `min-chars` threshold has been met, enabling consumers
  to render an "Add new…" affordance

---

## [18.5.0] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Scoped `NguiAutoCompleteService` per-component instance (was a module singleton — multiple simultaneous
  `<ngui-auto-complete>` components overwrote each other's `source` property causing a runtime crash)
- `isLoading` no longer stays stuck `true` after a failed HTTP request — `error` handler now resets it
- `ngOnDestroy` subscription teardown: replaced invalid `EventEmitter.unsubscribe()` calls with proper
  RxJS `Subscription` management via `dropdownSubs`
- Replaced `UntypedFormControl` / `UntypedFormGroup` with typed `FormControl` / `FormGroup`
- Root `.eslintrc.json` referenced non-existent `e2e/tsconfig.json` — removed
- Project ESLint configs used file-relative tsconfig paths — changed to workspace-root-relative
- `demo:prefix` in `angular.json` was `docs` instead of `app`
- Removed broken `ct` Cypress component-test target from the library `angular.json` entry
  (referenced non-existent `auto-complete:serve` target)
- `auto-select-first-item` demo was missing `[auto-select-first-item]="true"` — feature was never active

### Changed
- Replaced deprecated `karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter` with `karma-coverage`
- Removed unused `@types/jasminewd2` (Protractor artefact, not needed with Cypress)
- Pinned `cypress` to `^13.0.0` instead of `"latest"`
- Demo Observable source example replaced from Marvel API (broken auth) to Open Library (free, no key)
- Demo HTTP source examples replaced from Google Maps (requires key) to Nominatim/OpenStreetMap (free, no key)
- RTL demo updated to use Arabic city names with `dir="rtl"` scoped to the demo area only

### Added
- Angular Material toolbar in demo app with library title and links to GitHub / npm
- Demo examples use `<mat-card>` layout in a responsive CSS grid (2-column desktop, 1-column mobile)
- Collapsible "View Template" expansion panel per demo example
- `MatToolbarModule`, `MatCardModule`, `MatExpansionModule`, `MatButtonModule` added to demo module
- Revamped `styles.scss`: indigo-pink Material theme, global typography, dark code-block styling
- Descriptive subtitles and usage hints on all directive and component demo examples
- Restructured README: badges, API reference table, version-compatibility table, updated dev instructions
